icon - used to set a different icon in the tree view. Must be a valid octicon (see https://octicons.github.com) or codicon (see https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html). If using codicons, specify them in the format "$(icon)". The icon defaults to a tick if it's not valid. You can also use "todo-tree", or "todo-tree-filled" if you want to use the icon from the activity view.

iconColour - used to set the colour of the icon in the tree. If not specified, it will try to use the foreground colour or the background colour. Colour can be specified as per foreground and background colours, except that theme colours are only available when using codicons. Theme colours are not supported for octicons.

gutterIcon - set to true to show the icon in the editor gutter. Note: Unfortunately, only octicons and the todo-tree icon can be displayed in the gutter.

rulerColour - used to set the colour of the marker in the overview ruler. If not specified, it will default to use the foreground colour. Colour can be specified as per foreground and background colours.

rulerLane - used to set the lane for the marker in the overview ruler. If not specified, it will default to the right hand lane. Use one of "left", "center", "right", or "full". You can also use "none" to disable the ruler markers.

type - used to control how much is highlighted in the editor. Valid values are:

"type":
"type":"tag",
"type":"text",
"type":"tag-and-comment",
"type":"text-and-comment",
"type":"line",
"type":"whole-line",

tag - highlights just the tag
text - highlights the tag and any text after the tag
tag-and-comment - highlights the comment characters (or the start of the match) and the tag
text-and-comment - highlights the comment characters (or the start of the match), the tag and the text after the tag
line - highlights the entire line containing the tag
whole-line - highlights the entire line containing the tag to the full width of the editor


hideFromTree - used to hide tags from the tree, but still highlight in files

hideFromStatusBar - prevents the tag from being included in the status bar counts

Highlighting tags is configurable. Use defaultHighlight to set up highlights for all tags. If you need to configure individual tags differently, use customHighlight. If settings are not specified in customHighlight, the value from defaultHighlight is used. If a setting is not specified in defaultHighlight then the older, deprecated icon, iconColour and iconColours settings are used.

Both defaultHighlight and customHighlight allow for the following settings:

foreground - used to set the foreground colour of the highlight in the editor and the marker in the ruler.

background - used to set the background colour of the highlight in the editor.

Note: Foreground and background colours can be specified using HTML/CSS colour names (e.g. "Salmon"), RGB hex values (e.g. "#80FF00"), RGB CSS style values (e.g. "rgb(255,128,0)" or colours from the current theme, e.g. peekViewResult.background. Hex and RGB values can also have an alpha specified, e.g. "#ff800080" or "rgba(255,128,0,0.5)".

opacity - percentage value used with the background colour. 100% will produce an opaque background which will obscure selection and other decorations. Note: opacity can only be specified when hex or rgb colours are used.

fontWeight, fontStyle, textDecoration - can be used to style the highlight with standard CSS values.

borderRadius - used to set the border radius of the background of the highlight.

icon - used to set a different icon in the tree view. Must be a valid octicon (see https://octicons.github.com) or codicon (see https://microsoft.github.io/vscode-codicons/dist/codicon.html). If using codicons, specify them in the format "$(icon)". The icon defaults to a tick if it's not valid. You can also use "todo-tree", or "todo-tree-filled" if you want to use the icon from the activity view.

iconColour - used to set the colour of the icon in the tree. If not specified, it will try to use the foreground colour or the background colour. Colour can be specified as per foreground and background colours, except that theme colours are only available when using codicons. Theme colours are not supported for octicons.

gutterIcon - set to true to show the icon in the editor gutter. Note: Unfortunately, only octicons and the todo-tree icon can be displayed in the gutter.

rulerColour - used to set the colour of the marker in the overview ruler. If not specified, it will default to use the foreground colour. Colour can be specified as per foreground and background colours.

rulerLane - used to set the lane for the marker in the overview ruler. If not specified, it will default to the right hand lane. Use one of "left", "center", "right", or "full". You can also use "none" to disable the ruler markers.

type - used to control how much is highlighted in the editor. Valid values are:

tag - highlights just the tag
text - highlights the tag and any text after the tag
tag-and-comment - highlights the comment characters (or the start of the match) and the tag
text-and-comment - highlights the comment characters (or the start of the match), the tag and the text after the tag
line - highlights the entire line containing the tag
whole-line - highlights the entire line containing the tag to the full width of the editor
hideFromTree - used to hide tags from the tree, but still highlight in files

hideFromStatusBar - prevents the tag from being included in the status bar counts

Example:

"todo-tree.highlights.defaultHighlight": {
    "icon": "alert",
    "type": "text",
    "foreground": "red",
    "background": "white",
    "opacity": 50,
    "iconColour": "blue"
},
"todo-tree.highlights.customHighlight": {
    "TODO": {
        "icon": "check",
        "type": "line"
    },
    "FIXME": {
        "foreground": "black",
        "iconColour": "yellow",
        "gutterIcon": true
    }
}
Note: The highlight configuration is separate from the settings for the search. Adding settings in customHighlight does not automatically add the tags into todo-tree.general.tags.
